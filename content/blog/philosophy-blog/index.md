Why Philosophy?

The reason for this blog is my personal interest which is my profound interest as a perception made against the false pre assumptions of the name.
The detailed explanations will be given as we go on..

## What is Philosophy?

We hear a lot of time the word "philosophy" being sound to us in different kinds of contexts, like regarding the character of a person or regarding the understanding of a book or in the aspects of social kind.

But how to generalize this?

No we cant generalize Philosophy because it is **everything**.
Starting from the ancestoral or the mythological beliefs, Philosophy stands as the prime motto extending explanations to all the reasoning for the questions arising as the life cycle is improving till date.

Sometimes a misjudgement is being made abstracting that philosophy as an ideology of an individual. No it doesn't captivate to it. It is a false perception which i think should not be rendered to the display.

## The sub-atomics of Philosophy

In the process of evolving world,the characterizations of philosophy can be drafted down->

- Metaphysics: the origin of objects
- Epistemology: the theory of knowledge
- Etymology: the origin of words
- Psychology: the behaviour of human mind
- Logic: the reason for the thought
- Sociology: the regards of the surroundings

and we can go on extending the roots of philosophy to every question that arises and has arised into existence.

## We are in..

> So an unidentical question arises what aspect should we consider in philosophy. This cant be resolved because at each stage of life each root has to be picked depending on the situations arising.
> For Eg:
>
> - A student will learn a Philosophy of Epistemology
> - A politician participates in the Philosophy of Sociology
> - A mathematician works on the Philosophy of Logic

## Conclusion

So the sustainable conclusion can be that a philosophical entity cant be restricted to just an individual or an issue.
A great deal of philosophy must be stuffed in every individual and every aspect which can be the foreground where the humanity sails on.

A great philosopher once stated "Contradictory innovations became contemporary permanents". Hence a provoking thought in you makes a whole sense of society.
