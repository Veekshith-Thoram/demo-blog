Being a typical engineering student, going cracy for cyber security and ethical hacking is a bit of fantasy for many. So here you are going to exploit various up and down factors in the process of learning.

Here are the two major things which we discuss:

    >Why Linux?

    >Dont know Linux perfectly, then how you can encounter your fantasy.

## Why Linux?

In most Ethical Hacking and Pentesting tools are designed for **linux**,**unix** environment to work in combination with terminals.
Windows is not a best option of OS to perform these kind of activities because it is **harder to get anonymous** in Windows.

Since most of us are familiarized with Windows OS right from childhood, you might be doubtful whether to get into the fantasy or not.

No problem, I have exquisite solutions to this typical fantasy doubts of yours..

    >1.Multiple OS Booting
    >2.VirtualBox

Yup the above two are an effective way where you can make up stuff as you like.

1.Multiple OS Booting

    This technique is quite a bit difficult if you know the basics of operating system and booting OS. Booting is simply installing an OS into your PC or Laptop. Whereas Multiple Booting refers to Installing Multiple OS softwares into your device.
    The best option which i suggest is to initially boot your device with Linux distribution of your choice because Linux OS boot partition is more efficient compared to that of Windows. So by doing it like this way, there is more data security and more chances of data recovery.
    If you already have a Windows OS running in your device, then also you can boot it with Linux but there is a chance that if the booting process is interrupted in between, the data stored previously may be dislocated. So here we have an alternative to still install **Linux into your Windows** which is our Main Interest here.
